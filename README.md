# Medusa-Toolhead
**__IN BETA 3__**
![FrontView](/img/frontview.png)

**Beta 3 Changelog:**
- Removed the slide in belt attachment method. You now loop around a post and ziptie the belt to itself, Ã  la VZBot. (Pardon my french)

- Much Much MUCH stiffer. Horizontal bar that holds extruder and hotend does not flex at all now.

- Removed compability for the BLTouch as it is too unreliable inside a 60C enclosure.

- Narrowed down the Umbilical options to:

	I. Straight umbilical with strain relief.

	II. Hartk Afterburner Toolhead board. (ALOT of different wiring            harnesses on aliexpress made to work with this board that                facilitate 		   wiring overall)

- Standardized the screw sizes.

- CFD work to align the airflow from the duct better.

### Assembly

## **2. Tensioning Idlers**

Belt mounting on the toolhead itself is very simplified to save weight. You will need to print the tensioning front idlers and replace the static stock ones. This will allow you to tension the belts.

### Bom
	- 2x M5x40mm Button Head (Idler shaft)
	- 2x M5 Standard Nut (Idler shaft)
	- 4x M6x8mm (Mouting the idlers to the frame - Reuse the ones used to hold the old idlers in place)
	- 2x M3x30mm Button Head (Tensioning Screw)
	- 12x M3 Heatset insert M3x4mmx4mm

## **3. Klicky Probe**
 Currently supports [Klicky probe](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe) with a custom toolhead mount and dock mount.

## **4. Z Endstop**
 Based on the Z endstop present on [Voron 3D Printers](https://github.com/VoronDesign).

 Acts as your z endstop and lets you use the [Z Calibration tool](https://github.com/protoloft/klipper_z_calibration) in conjunction with the Klicky Probe, to automatically set your Z offset independently of nozzle or print surface.

### Bom
	-2x M3x20mm Button Head (Mounting to bed)
	-2x M3 Standard Nut (Mounting to bed)
	-1x 5mm x 25mm Steel shaft
	-1x Omron D2F Microswitch or similar
	-1x 20-tooth timing pulley (deflanged)

 If you are having trouble taking the flange off the pulley visit the [version 2.2](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/tree/Voron2.2/STLs/VORON2.2/Tools) of the Voron repository under tools. After printing out the hub puller and using the bolts from the kit, de-flanging is very easy.
